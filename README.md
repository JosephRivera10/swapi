# Frontend Project: Star Wars Opening Crawl
## Overview

Your task is to display the opening crawl of a Star Wars movie.

You have 60 minutes to complete the work. Your submission will be evaluated on how well it satisfies requirements, the code clarity and how easily the project could be extended into a full application.

## Main Task

A customer wants you to deliver opening title crawls to Star Wars movies displayed on a simple website. You can break down the work into the following steps:

1. Scaffold your project. You should develop code to host a small website available at `localhost`. External tools like `create-react-app` are recommended.
2. Collect data from an API. Your site should make an API request to the Star Wars API to get the data you need. Use the GraphiQL link to investigate the data. We’d prefer it if you use the GraphQL API, but the REST API is also acceptable:
   1. GraphiQL: https://graphql.org/swapi-graphql 
   2. GraphQL:  https://swapi-graphql.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/index
   3. REST: https://www.swapi.tech/
3. Display data filtered by user input. Users should be able to input a movie name and see the opening crawl for that movie. Content should be structured as React components.

Once you have completed these steps, you’re done with the core task, but you may choose to attempt any of the following **bonus** sections:

1. Unit tests for your components.
2. Make it look nice!
3. Create a wireframe, mockup, or prototype of how you might expand on this project. Use a tool like Adobe XD, Sketch, Figma, etc.
4. Graph out metric data – for example, the average height across all species in a given movie.
5. Integration tests for your API calls.
6. Authentication for users to log into your site. 

## Requirements

1. You should use React, and are free to use other common libraries or add-ons.
2. You should be able to demo your prototype. Bonus if we can checkout and run it.
3. You have 60 minutes to complete the work.
4. You should add this repository and make a PR against it with your solution.

Please ask questions! Don’t be shy – we value good communication.

Good luck!
